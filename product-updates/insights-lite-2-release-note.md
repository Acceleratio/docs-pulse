# SysKit Insights Lite 2.0.0

New SharePoint 2019 is here, and so is our SysKit Insights Lite.

This is a release that brings only a handful of bug fixes and **support for SharePoint 2019.** Also, to correspond more with its "big brother" - [SysKit Insights](https://www.syskit.com/products/insights/), SysKit Pulse **has been renamed to SysKit Insights Lite**.

SysKit Insights Lite continues to, and forever will be **FREE.**

**Product version:** 2.0.0  
**Build number:** 545  
**Release date:** Oct 30, 2018
