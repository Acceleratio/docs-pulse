Here is what you need to do to start using our application:

* Unpack and run the SPDocKitSetupPulse.msi. The wizard will guide you through the installation steps.
* Once installed, start the application from the Start menu or Desktop shortcut.
* On first launch, configure AutoDiscover by selecting which Organizational Units to discover and track. These settings can be reviewed later.
